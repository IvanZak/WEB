				<h2>Facebook</h2>
					<p>Facebook is a popular free social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video, send messages and keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues. The site, which is available in 37 different languages, includes public features such as marketplace, groups, events, pages and presence technology.</p>
					<p>Within each member's personal profile, there are several key networking components: the Wall, which is essentially a virtual bulletin board; the virtual Photo Album (an interactive album feature allows the member's contacts to comment on each other's photos and identify people in the photos); status updates, a microblogging feature that allows members to broadcast short Twitter-like announcements to their friends.  </p>
					<p>Facebook offers a range of privacy options to its members.  A member can make all his communications visible to everyone, he can block specific connections or he can keep all his communications private. Members can choose whether or not to be searchable, decide which parts of their profile are public, decide what not to put in their news feed and determine exactly who can see their posts. For those members who wish to use Facebook to communicate privately, there is a message feature, which closely resembles email. </p>
